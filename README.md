# YOLO V2 with Jupyter to detect fire phenomena
***
Here is a jupyter notebook featuring a complete implementation from scratch of YOLOV2 with Jupyter :

-Dataset pipeline with data augmentation

-Training from YOLO pretrained weights

-Visualization of object detection

I use this notebook to train a model to detect fire. The goal is to detect fire in real time for safety.

## Requirements

* PaddleX 2.0
* cv2
